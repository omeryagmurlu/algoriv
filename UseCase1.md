We already implemented a usage manual in Algoriva. There are two use cases shown by diagrams below.

See How DFS Works
Preconditions: Algoriva is installed.

Basic Flow of Events

1.The user runs Algoriva and clicks on the 'Algorithms' section.
2.The user chooses DFS and clicks on the play button.
3.The system asks for a starting vertex and the user types any number.
4.Algoriva starts the animation.

Alternative Flows
1a. The user clicks on one of the other three sections.
   1a1.The user clicks on the MAIN arrow.
2a. The user chooses an algorithm else than DFS.
   2a1.The user clicks on ALGORITHMS arrow.
2b. The user clicks on the left bar.
  2b1. The user reads the explanation about DFS and chooses an example graph.
  2b2. The user chooses 'Custom Graphs'.
      2b2a. The user enters a name for the new graph which is on the screen.
2c. The user clicks on the right bar and sees the code block and a table showing whether the nodes visited.
2d. The user clicks on the forward/ previous/rewind/end button.
  2d1. The system assumes starting vertex as 0 and jumps to the 4th step.
3a. The user types a letter and faces with a message: 'node doesn't exist (letter)'
  3a1. The user deletes the letter.
3b. The user types too big number and faces with a message: 'node doesn't exist (too big number)'
   3b1. The user deletes that number and types an existing smaller number.
   3b2. The user adds nodes by CTRL + LEFT CLICK.
        3b2a. The user connects the new node with any other existing node by clicking on the nodes to be connected.
           3b2a1. The system asks for a weight, the user enters a value.
