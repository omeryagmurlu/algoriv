# Usage Manual

There is a main visualization area, 2 sidebars and some controls in the algorithm views. Clicking on their handles opens sidebars. Animation controls consist of: back-to-beginning, one-step-back, pause/start/restart, one-step-forward, to-end and a speed slider to control animation speed. Necessary input is to be supplied upon clicking on the start button, which prompts for these inputs. Main area and sidebars consist of modules, which can be customized or toggled on/off in settings. The app has multiple themes to choose from.

## Usage of modules

Most modules are static, meaning that they don't support interactions, they are only visual. Interactive modules are:

* Graph module
* Examples module

### Graph module

Graph used in the visualization can be changed by ctrl-clicking on the graph. To add an edge ctrl-click on two nodes consequently. To add a node ctrl-click on the stage, to remove one ctrl-alt-click. If the graph is weighted, then a modal asks for weight when you add an edge. If a node/edge cannot be removed/added because of reasons, an info message pops up, informing the user of these reasons. Graph module, by default, features colors and animations to visualize graphs better.

### Examples module

Examples and Custom Input module is found by default on the left sidebar. Users have the ability to select from multiple examples which are fine tuned for the algorithm, or can save their own customized input and use it. Users can later delete or rename these inputs. Custom inputs are persistent and will stay after application exits.

Options for this module:

* Purge custom inputs: removes all custom inputs

## Options

* Theme
* Algorithm speed
* Minimal Colored Visualizations: whether or not to use color in Visualizations
* Animations: are animations enabled
