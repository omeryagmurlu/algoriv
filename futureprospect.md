  At the beginning we made a brainstorm about frequently faced problems. After finding out on which problem we are going to work, we made a research about it. A survey questioning the  students is prepared to specify the problem. We interpreted our survey results. Then we decided our first part of solution. We were going to build our project on visualization. We drove a mind map on a white board. Whenever we meet, both of us wrote their new ideas. Later we chose the most efficient ideas to realize, but never wiped out the other choices. Now they are waiting on the white board under the 'future features' title. We are willing to develop our project. We are also willing to be found interesting by other developers, so that more people would work on this project. Because we really want to solve the problem, Algoriva should be published online freely in our opinion.
