Purpose
Algoriva works up to give a hand for programmers who suffer from the abstract flow of algorithm design. It interacts with the user at every step so that the user can arrange the functions of Algoriva in her own way. 

Scope
This project consists of an animation visualizing customizable codes based on the predefined algorithms. Modules of the program include graphs and trees, which can be regulated by the user. Not only the code but also additional general information about the visualized algorithm are given at the same time. Bright colors are used for the animation to pave the way for following up the processed nodes. The user can change themes, for example when Algoriva is used under low light, one can set the dark theme so that eye health is protected. Furthermore one can write her own code and Algoriva checks for syntax errors, then runs the code and visualizes that new algorithm defined by the user without any preconditions. This Custom Code mode is what makes the biggest difference between Algoriva and other visualization programs on the market.

Stakeholder Identification
The program is for intermediate programmers, who basically knows fundamental elements of JavaScript. Majorly visual learners are recommended to experience Algoriva in order to obtain efficiency.

Social & Educational Value
Algoriva is designed for the programming learners considering teaching methods such as demonstration and collaboration.
With Algoriva more and more people keep learning to program without giving up on neither abstract thinking nor algorithm designing. Algoriva aims to lower the daunting ratio of programmers, who will become computer scientists and software developers in the future.
