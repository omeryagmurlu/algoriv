Purpose
Algoriva aims to give a hand for programmers who suffer from the abstract flow of algorithm design. It interacts with the user at every step so that the user can arrange the functions of Algoriva in her own way. 

Scope
There are two main functions of the software. First one is visualizing the pre-defined algorithms, such as BFS, DFS, Djikstra's / Kosaraju's / Kruskal's / Prim's Algorithms and Topological Sorting. The user chooses one of the example graphs titled by their virtues or creates a new graph, which will be memorized by Algoriva later if saved. Not only the code but also additional general information about the visualized algorithm are given at the same time. Bright colors are used in the animation so that important parts in it can be highlighted.
The other main function is to compile, run and visualize the custom code written by the user. Algoriva understands that newly described algorithm and develops a genuine animation. This Custom Code mode is what makes the biggest difference between Algoriva and other visualization programs on the market. While Algoriva is demonstrating how the user's algorithm works, the processed line of the code is highlighted and the table of the nodes shows the values of the nodes.
Moreover, the user can change themes. For example when Algoriva is used under low light, one can set the dark theme so that eye health is protected.

Intended Population
The program is for intermediate programmers, who basically knows fundamental elements of JavaScript. Majorly visual learners are recommended to experience Algoriva in order to obtain efficiency.

Social & Educational Value
      Heading away from the fact that science and technology shape our future, we want to make a contribution to education. According to the survey* results, the most popular subject of late years is the computer science. Considering the mass of people interested in computer science enlarges directly proportional to the popularity, more problems come up and wait to be solved during the learning process. Algoriva is designed for those who faces problems when it comes to the abstraction. During the development of Algoriva teaching methods such as demonstration and collaboration are considered. Thus Algoriva can be used in the classrooms as an educational tool. The cross-platform aspect of the software allows portability even on smartboards. With Algoriva more and more people keep learning to program without giving up on neither abstract thinking nor algorithm designing. Algoriva aims to lower the daunting ratio of programmers, who will become computer scientists and software developers of the future.
